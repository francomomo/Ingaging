# Ingaging

A club event management and ticketing application developed in microservice architecture.

Technology: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Next.js, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes

The application is a follow-along of Stephen Grider's "Microservices with Node.js and React" course. It is my attempt to learn about microservices architecture and to build an well-architected microservices application at the same time.

For now, only the authentication service is completed. More functionalities and more services (payment, order, etc.) will be developed if I have free time!
